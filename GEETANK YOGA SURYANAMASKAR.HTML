<H2>Q.What is The Sun Salutation (SURYANAMASKAR)? </H2>
<P>The Sun Salutation, known as Surya Namaskar in Sanskrit, is a dynamic and rhythmic sequence of yoga postures organized in a flowing series. It is a fundamental practice in yoga that serves as a comprehensive warm-up, energizing the body, and enhancing flexibility and strength. The Sun Salutation is not only a physical exercise but also holds spiritual and symbolic significance, representing the gratitude and connection to the life-giving energy of the sun.

The sequence typically consists of 12 distinct poses performed in a coordinated manner, seamlessly transitioning from one posture to the next. Each movement is synchronized with the breath, creating a meditative flow that combines physical exercise with mindful awareness.

The Sun Salutation often includes postures such as Mountain Pose (Tadasana), Downward-Facing Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana), Cobra Pose (Bhujangasana), and others. The sequence begins and ends with a standing posture, symbolizing the cycle of a day and the sun's journey across the sky.

Surya Namaskar is not only a physical practice but also a spiritual one, acknowledging the vital role of the sun in sustaining life on Earth. It is commonly used as a warm-up at the beginning of a yoga session but can also be practiced on its own for its holistic benefits.

The Sun Salutation is versatile and can be adapted to various yoga styles and levels of practice. It offers a balanced combination of stretching, strengthening, and breathing exercises, making it an integral part of many yoga routines. Practitioners often find the Sun Salutation to be invigorating, promoting a sense of vitality and well-being.
