Corpse Pose, or Shavasana in Sanskrit, is a foundational and final relaxation yoga pose. It is often practiced at the end of a yoga session to promote deep relaxation, integration of the benefits of the practice, and a sense of inner peace. In Shavasana, the body lies flat on the back, arms are at the sides, and legs are extended with feet slightly apart. The palms of the hands are turned upward, and the eyes are closed. The name "Shavasana" is derived from two Sanskrit words: "Shava," meaning corpse, and "Asana," meaning pose or posture. The pose symbolizes the surrender of the practitioner to a state of complete relaxation and stillness, resembling a resting corpse.
