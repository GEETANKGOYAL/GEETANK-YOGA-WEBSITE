<P>With the advent of technological devices, throughout the day,
 more than half the populace spends time crouched in front of a
 desktop or monitor at their workplaces and rivetted to chairs
 watching television or a smartphone in their leisurely hours. 
The unhealthy sitting postures at work or home gradually lead to
 posture misalignment, stiff muscles and sudden muscle strain or pull.
 Well, for people who have overly busy schedules and cannot make time
 for a full-fledged workout session, if there is something that 
corrects this postural issue in a jiffy, 
it is the foundational yoga pose known as Tadasana.</P>







<P>Mountain Pose, or Tadasana, is a foundational yoga pose 
that serves as the starting point for many standing poses. 
It might seem simple at first glance, but when practiced mindfully,
 it can be a powerful pose for improving posture, balance, and 
concentration. </P>



<H2>Q.What is Mountain Pose-Tadasana? </H2>
<P>‘Tadasana’ is a Sanskrit term made up of two words where ‘tada’
 implies ‘palm’ or ‘mountain’ and ‘asana’ signifies ‘posture’ or ‘
seat’. The Tadasana posture is the physical embodiment of standing 
strong like a tree or a vast mountain. Hence, it is also called the
 Mountain pose or palm tree stance.

When a person stands in the Tadasana posture, their spine or ver
tebral column aligns perfectly in its natural curves. This enhan
ces the stability and vitality of the spine and vertebrae. Being
 the initial position of the Surya Namaskar, Tadasana is a basic
 yoga pose that sets the foundation for many other standing yoga
 postures.

Tadasana not only works on all the major muscles so that your posture is better but also bestows you with a pain-free experience while you are at your sedentary desk job. It works to realign your skeleton and bring it back to a neutral stance. Scientifically, the posture depends on the muscular effort that it takes to get into this asana which in turn helps strengthen the core muscles and unbend rounded crouched backs. Additionally, it also bolsters your shoulders, ankles, thighs, knees, and back.

<h2> Q.What Are The Benefits Of Tadasana?</h2>
<P>
<H4><B>#Enhances Your Posture</B></H4>
Practising the Mountain Pose can be of great help to people who have the instinct to hunch or slouch while walking or sitting. On performing this asana regularly, the back pain due to the hunched posture gradually disappears which finally improves the overall posture and helps a person to naturally stand tall.
<H4><B>#Assist In Increasing Height</B></H4>
A good height always has an added benefit to one’s personality. People who have a predisposed fear of attaining a shorter height can start practising this asana in their teenage years to add a few extra inches to their height. The elongation or stretch while doing the asana activates posture pressure which in turn boosts the production of growth hormone that helps in stretching all parts of the body.
<H4><B>#Boosts Mental Awareness</B></H4>
Yoga is not just about physical movement and breathing but meditation too. The mountain pose awakens the chakras and helps one connect to their deeper consciousness by broadening their mental awareness. It arouses creativity and intuition and clears the fogginess of the mind. Practising it routinely makes one feel calmer, and composed, make positive choices and beat depression while also consolidating the nervous system.
<H4><B>#Promotes Breathing</B></H4>
The exponential increase in environmental pollution and smog has led to most people reporting issues related to clogged-up lungs and other breathing troubles. Tadasana helps open up the alveolar passages within the lungs and allows one to breathe deeply without any obstruction.
<H4><B>#Aids In Weight Loss</B></H4>
Yogasana is one such holistic approach that not only uplifts overall bodily functions but also helps achieve an appropriate weight. Alongside other yoga postures, Tadasana improves body metabolism and helps burn calories faster.
