<p>Seated Forward Bend, known as Paschimottanasana in Sanskrit, is a yoga pose that involves sitting on the floor and folding forward from the hips to reach towards your toes. In this asana, the spine is lengthened, and the emphasis is on stretching the back of the body, particularly the spine and hamstrings. It is often practiced in seated meditation or as part of a yoga sequence. The name "Paschimottanasana" is derived from three Sanskrit words: "Paschima," meaning west or back of the body, "Ut," meaning intense, and "Tan," meaning to stretch or extend. The pose is also referred to as the Seated Forward Bend or simply Forward Bend.
