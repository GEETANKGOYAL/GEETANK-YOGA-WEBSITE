Child's Pose, or Balasana, is a fundamental and restorative yoga posture that invites practitioners to assume a comfortable and nurturing position on the mat. In this pose, the individual sits back on their heels, folding the torso forward, and reaching the arms out in front or resting them alongside the body. This gentle forward bend allows the chest to rest close to or between the thighs, promoting a sense of release and surrender.
